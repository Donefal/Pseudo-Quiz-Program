# Pseudo-Quiz-Program
A simple personal C++ program that inspired by Quizziz and its vast features
Or... you can say it's a huge spaghetti mess which I used to learn

## What is this program?
It's basically a quiz program! It manages quizzes, assign it to the student, and let them do the work all in one place. You can choose between some type of question type like Multiple Choices, Short Answer, and Answerless, then add question to it. You can see all the past saved question and see how well your student do in the quiz (kind of)

## Features
- Different type of question type
- Ability to save and edit quizzes and questions
- Data Filters!

## What I learn from making this program
- A lot of C++ classes and its terms: "Objects, method, property, instancing, constructor, destructor, base class, derived class, etc."
- Smart Pointers: How it can be used with classes, and also the pros & cons of using it
- Raw Pointers: How it can be better in some cases than the smart ones
- Namespaces: Making my own namespaces and the better practice of using it
- Pass by reference and pass by value
- File handling: Creating & Deleting files

## What I can improve:
- **It feels like a spaghetti code**. Many of its functions that basically do the same thing have different kind of approach. Like its loop, parameter, return value, or how it works in general is different even though it have the same usage.
  - I should plan ahead first and structure the program in a more appropriate way instead of doing it head first
- It obviously can have a better interface and features. But, I've already spending too much time for a project like this. I don't want to push myself to perfection especially for a project that its purpose is just a media to learn a little bit about OOP.
